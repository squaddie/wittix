To test this project, run the bash script located in the root of the project: `./start.sh`. This script will create an admin user, build and start the Docker containers, execute the migrations, and start the queue worker.

Ensure the script has the correct permissions by running: `chmod +x start.sh`.

To log in, use admin for both the username and password on the login page.
